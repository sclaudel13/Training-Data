# Modeling-Credit-Card-Default-Risk-and-Customer-Profitability
In this project we have a group of people who want credits cards from a bank, and model uses the historical data on people who were granted credit cards and some defaulted and some did not.
i will use the historical data to forecast who will default in the future, based on the same input variables for new people that i have on my training set and test of about 400 people.

# Part 1: Building a Binary Classification model
The bank initially collected six pieces of data about each person: Age, Years at current employer, Years at current address, Income over the past year, Current credit card debt and
current automobile debt. In addition the bank has a binary outcome: default=1, and no default=0.

Model = -0.21*Years At Employer-0.15&Credit Card Debt-0.05* Automobile-0.03*Age

# Part 2: Should the bank Buy a Third-Party credit information?

Comparing my model with a Third-Party credit information
